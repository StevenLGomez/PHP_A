# Add pages necessary to edit Pages, similar to what exists for Subjects

Pages:
    manage_content.php (Already exists)
    new_page.php (but note that new_subject was a two step process)
    edit_page.php
    delete_page.php

-> Single page submission sounds best..

Watch out for:
    pages.content (new database field to manage)
    Display, validate, escape whenever appropriate
    Edit using HTML textarea field

Subject ID
    New pages: send it and save it (to save heirarchy dependency intent)
    Existing pages: look it up

Page Position
    Only count pages with the same parent Subject
